##  Project Description

This project focuses on generating **Pascal's Triangle** using **Python**. You will write a function that builds a triangle of `n` rows, represented as a list of lists, applying core algorithmic and programming skills.

---

##  Learning Objectives

To successfully complete this project, you should have a solid understanding of the following Python concepts:

- **Lists and List Comprehensions**
- **Functions & Parameters**
- **Loops (for, while, nested)**
- **Conditional Statements**
- **Arithmetic Operations**
- **Indexing and Slicing**
- (Optional) **Recursion**
- (Optional) **Error and Exception Handling**
- **Efficiency and Optimization**

##  Background

**Pascalâ€™s Triangle** is a triangular array where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It begins as follows:

  [1]
 [1,1]
[1,2,1]

[1,3,3,1] [1,4,6,4,1] ...

## âœ… Task

### `0. Pascal's Triangle`

Create a function:

```python
def pascal_triangle(n):

Requirements:
Returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n

Returns an empty list if n <= 0

Assumes n is always an integer
