# ALX Interview

Welcome to the **ALX Interview** repository — a collection of algorithmic coding challenges, problem-solving exercises, and technical interview prep tasks completed as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program.

This repository contains various mini-projects, each focusing on different concepts and problem-solving strategies that are commonly encountered during technical interviews.

## Current Project

### `0x00. Pascal's Triangle`

> Build a function in Python to generate Pascal’s Triangle of `n` rows.

- Task: Write `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers
-  Concepts: List comprehension, nested loops, indexing
- Directory: `0x00-pascal_triangle`
